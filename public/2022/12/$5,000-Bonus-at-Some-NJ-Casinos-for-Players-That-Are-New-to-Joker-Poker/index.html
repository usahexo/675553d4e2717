This relatively new game is quickly gaining popularity, and some New Jersey casinos are now offering a $5,000 bonus to players who are new to the game.</p>
<p>What is Joker Poker?</p>
<p>Joker Poker is a variation of Deuces Wild that includes a joker as one of the 4 wild cards. The joker can be used as any other card to form a winning hand. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, and the goal is to create the best five-card poker hand possible.</p>
<p>How Do I Play?</p>
<p>To play, you’ll first need to place your bet. You can then select any five cards from your hand to hold. The remaining cards will be replaced with new ones from the deck. If you end up with a winning hand, you’ll receive payouts according to the payout schedule listed below.</p>
<p>What Are the Payouts?</p>
<p>The payouts for Joker Poker vary depending on the rank of the hand. Here’s a look at the payouts for some common hands:</p>
<p>Hand Payout Royal flush 1000:1 Straight flush 200:1 Four of a kind 50:1 Full house 6:1 Flush 5:1 Straight 4:1 Three of a kind 3:1 Two pairs 2:1 One pair 1:1 Joker (wild) 0:2-200</p>

<h1 id="Play-Joker-Poker-and-Get-a-Free-Spin-on-the-‘Wheel-of-Fortune’-Slot"><a href="#Play-Joker-Poker-and-Get-a-Free-Spin-on-the-‘Wheel-of-Fortune’-Slot" class="headerlink" title="Play Joker Poker and Get a Free Spin on the ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Slot"></a>Play Joker Poker and Get a Free Spin on the ‘Wheel of Fortune’ Slot</h1><p>In joker poker, there are 52 cards in the deck, including one joker. The ranking of the cards is the same as in regular poker, with Ace being high and 2 being low. The joker can be used as any other card in the deck.</p>
<p>To play, you bet on one of five boxes, which will be noted on the table. After all bets have been placed, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player to the dealer’s left starts the betting, and players must either match the amount that has been bet or fold. Play passes clockwise around the table.</p>
<p>After the first betting round, the dealer flips over the first card in his or her hand. This is called the flop. Players now have a choice: they can either match the current bet or fold. Play again passes clockwise around the table.</p>
<p>The fourth card (the turn) is then flipped over, followed by a final betting round. The river is then flipped over (the fifth and final card). At this point, it becomes apparent who has won the pot - either by having the best hand or by having had opponents fold to them earlier in the game.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for an extra chance to win some money while playing Joker Poker, why not try out ‘Wheel of Fortune’ slot? It’s one of our most popular games here at Spin Palace and it’s easy to see why - just spin the wheel and watch your fortunes change!</p>
