If you are like most people, you probably think it is some sort of high-stakes card game only played by the rich and famous. In reality, Baccarat is a fairly simple game to learn and can be enjoyed by players of all skill levels.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a card game that is played between two players – the Banker and the Player. The object of the game is to draw cards that add up to nine (or as close as possible). The first player to reach nine (or go over) loses the game.</p>
<p>The Banker is always dealt two cards, while the Player is dealt one card. Aces are worth one point, 2s through 9s are worth face value, and 10s through King are worth zero points. If either the Banker or Player has an 8 or 9, they “stand” ( meaning they do not draw any additional cards). If either player has a total of less than five, they must take another card.</p>
<p>The Banker wins if their hand total is closer to nine than the Player’s hand, and the Player wins if their hand total is closer to nine than the Banker’s hand. In the event that both hands have the same value (a “push”), neither player wins or loses money.</p>
<p>So how does Baccarat Red Dead Stalin fit into all this? Well, it turns out that there is a variation of baccarat known as Baccarat Red Dead Stalin which uses three decks of cards instead of two. In this version of the game, when either the Banker or Player has a total of eight or nine, they still stand – but if they have a total of less than eight, they draw one more card (just like in regular baccarat).</p>
<p>This version of the game was created by Russian mathematician Andrei Andreyevich Andreyev in 1978 and named after Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin. While it may not be quite as popular as regular baccarat, Baccarat Red Dead Stalin can offer a bit more excitement for players looking for a challenge.</p>
<h1 id="You-Too-Can-Profit-from-Baccarat-Red-Dead-Stalin"><a href="#You-Too-Can-Profit-from-Baccarat-Red-Dead-Stalin" class="headerlink" title="You Too Can Profit from Baccarat Red Dead Stalin!"></a>You Too Can Profit from Baccarat Red Dead Stalin!</h1><p>You might be asking yourself how you can profit from Red Dead Stalin. Do not worry, for I am here to help. Just follow these simple steps and you too can make a fortune!</p>
<p>Baccarat is a simple card game that has been around for centuries. It is believed to have originated in Italy and then spread throughout Europe. The game eventually made its way to America, where it became popular in casinos. In modern times, baccarat has regained popularity, and can now be found in casinos all over the world.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a game that is played between two players, or between a player and the bank. The object of the game is to draw cards with a total value of nine or as close to nine as possible. The highest ranking card is an Ace, followed by two through ten. Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are all worth ten points. A hand with a total value of less than five is considered a “soft hand”, while a hand with a total value of five or more is considered a “hard hand”.</p>
<p>The player or bank begins by placing their bet on one of three possible outcomes – Player, Banker, or Tie. Two cards are then dealt to each player and the bank. The player then decides whether to draw another card (known as a “hit”) or stand with what they have. If the player busts (has a total value of over 21), they automatically lose regardless of what the bank has done. The same process is followed for the bank, with the exception that if the bank busts they lose regardless of what the player has done. The first person to reach nine points (or as close as possible) wins the hand. If both players reach nine at the same time, it is called a “push” and no one wins or loses money.</p>
<p>The house edge in baccarat varies depending on which version of the game you are playing, but typically sits at around 1%. This means that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose about $1 in the long run. While this may not seem like much, it can add up quickly if you are playing over an extended period of time.</p>
<p>There are two main ways that you can beat the house edge in baccarat and make a profit – by counting cards or by using basic strategy charts. Card counting involves keeping track of which cards have been played so that you can assign them specific point values. By doing this, you can predict which hands are most likely to win and make informed decisions about when to bet on them. Basic strategy charts involve making specific bets based on your hand value and the dealer’s upcard. This approach minimizes your losses while still giving you a good chance of winning some hands.</p>
<p>If you are interested in learning more about card counting or basic strategy charts for baccarat, there are plenty of resources available online that can teach you everything you need to know. With a little practice, you too can become an expert gambler and make some serious profits!</p>

<p>How to Play Baccarat Red Dead Stalin</p>
<p>The basic principle of baccarat Red Dead Stalin is very simple. You are trying to bet on which of two hands (the banker’s hand or the player’s hand) will be closest to nine. The hand with the total value closest to nine wins the round.</p>
<p>There are three possible outcomes in each round of baccarat Red Dead Stalin: Player Win, Banker Win, and Tie. The payout for each outcome is as follows:</p>
<p>Player Win: 1-1 (or Even Money)</p>
<p>Banker Win: -0.95% (of amount wagered)</p>
<p>Tie: 8-1 (or ƒ8 for every ƒ1 wagered)</p>

In order to win at Baccarat, you have to correctly predict which outcome will happen. There are three betting options: Player, Banker, and Tie. The Player and Banker bets pay even money, while the Tie bet pays 8-1.</p>
<p>The game of Baccarat is played with six decks of cards. The cards are shuffled after each hand is played. The player will be given two cards and the banker will be given two cards. The total number value of the two cards is what determines the outcome of the hand. The highest point value card is a 10 and the lowest point value card is a 2. So if you have a 3 and a 6, your total point value would be 9 (3+6&#x3D;9). Ace counts as 1 or 11, whichever makes the hand stronger.</p>
<p>If you have a total point value of 8 or 9, this is called a “natural” and the hand automatically wins. If you have a total point value of 7 or less than 7, this is called “bad” and the hand automatically loses. If you have a total point value of 2 through 6, then this is considered a “point” card and you must decide whether to take another card (hit) or stand on your total points (no hit).</p>
<p>The goal of Baccarat is to get as close to 9 as possible. So if you have a 4 and a 5 as your first two cards (4+5&#x3D;9), then this would be considered a strong hand because it totals 9. However, if you had an Ace and a 2 as your first two cards (1+2&#x3D;3), then this would be considered a weak hand because it totals 3 which isn’t close to 9 at all!</p>
<p>When playing Baccarat online or in live casinos, there are some important tips that you need to remember in order to increase your chances of winning:<br>-Never bet on Tie unless the odds are really good - usually around 10-1 or better. The house edge on Tie bets is around 14%.<br>-Make larger bets when betting on the Player or Banker hands - these bets have lower house edges than betting on Tie hands (around 1%-1.5% for Player&#x2F;Banker hands versus 14% for Tie hands).<br>-When taking another card (hitting), try to stay under 17 points so that you can still win with an Ace counting as 1 or 11 points.</p>

        <h1 id="Senators-launch-bill-to-legalize-sports-betting"><a href="#Senators-launch-bill-to-legalize-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Senators launch bill to legalize sports betting"></a>Senators launch bill to legalize sports betting</h1><p>WASHINGTON - October 26, 2017 </p>
<p>A bipartisan group of Senators have announced a new bill that would legalize sports betting in the United States. The proposed legislation comes in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision to strike down a federal law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>The bill, which was introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mike Lee (R-UT), would allow states to decide whether to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. The proposed legislation would also establish a regulatory framework for sports betting, including minimum age restrictions, consumer protections, and safeguards against fraud and game-fixing.</p>
<p>“I’m thrilled that Senator Schumer and Senator Lee are introducing this bill,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. “It is critical that we provide a legislative framework that allows for responsible gaming in states that choose to legalize it. This bill does just that.”</p>
<p>Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling, but supporters say that such concerns can be mitigated through strong consumer protections. They also note that legalization could generate significant revenue for state governments through taxes on bets made at casinos and other gambling establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Rep-proposes-RAWA-repeal-in-bid-to-legalize-sports-betting"><a href="#Rep-proposes-RAWA-repeal-in-bid-to-legalize-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Rep. proposes RAWA repeal in bid to legalize sports betting"></a>Rep. proposes RAWA repeal in bid to legalize sports betting</h1><p>A U.S. lawmaker has put forward a measure to repeal the failed federal ban on sports betting, arguing that it would generate some $27 billion in annual tax revenue.</p>
<p>The proposal to overturn the RAWA (Restoration of America’s Wire Act) was put forth by Republican Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah on Wednesday. The bill intends to legalize and regulate sports betting at the state level.</p>
<p>“This is a conservative estimate,” Bishop said in a statement, noting that the regulated market would also create jobs while protecting consumers and children from illegal gambling activities. “If we don’t pass this legislation, these dollars will go to other countries, and our states will continue to lose out on vital revenue.”</p>
<p>Bishop joins several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have voiced their support for legalizing and regulating sports betting in light of the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision last month to strike down a federal law that effectively outlawed it. The high court ruled that the law – known as PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) – violated the 10th Amendment by compelling states to prohibit wagering on sporting events.</p>
<p>Since the ruling, several states have signaled their intention to move forward with legalizing sports betting within their borders. Delaware became the first state to allow single-game bets last week, followed by New Jersey – which is expected to begin taking bets within weeks – and West Virginia, which plans to offer sports betting by September. Mississippi also approved a measure this week that would allow casinos in the state to offer legal sports betting pending approval from regulators.</p>
<p>Critics of RAWA say that its passage would not only overturn decades of legal precedent but also conflict with the wishes of most Americans, who support legalizing sports betting. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in May found that 67 percent of Americans favor allowing legalized sports betting nationwide, including Republicans (57 percent), Democrats (77 percent) and independents (68 percent).</p>
<h1 id="Sports-gambling-could-be-legalized-by-the-end-of-the-year"><a href="#Sports-gambling-could-be-legalized-by-the-end-of-the-year" class="headerlink" title="Sports gambling could be legalized by the end of the year"></a>Sports gambling could be legalized by the end of the year</h1><p>States are close to reaching an agreement that would legalize sports gambling across the nation. The proposed bill, which was introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, would overturn a 1992 law that effectively banned sports gambling.</p>
<p>The bill would allow states to individually decide whether or not to legalize sports gambling and would give them authority to regulate and tax the activity. In addition, it would create a federal regulatory framework for sports betting operators.</p>
<p>“The current state-by-state approach to sports betting is patently unfair,” Hatch said in a statement. “It’s time to bring this longstanding issue out of the shadows and into the light of day.”</p>
<p>Sports gambling is currently legal in only four states: Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. The proposed bill would enable states with existing gaming laws – such as New Jersey – to offer full-scale sports betting operations.</p>
<p>The NFL has been a vocal opponent of legalized sports gambling, but the league may be changing its tune. In a recent interview, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league is open to legalized sports gambling if it includes “proper protections” for the game.</p>
<p>Goodell said that he doesn’t want legalized gambling to change the fundamental nature of the NFL game or put players at risk of manipulation by gamblers. He also expressed concerns about underage gambling and addiction issues.</p>
<p>If passed, the proposed bill would take effect in January 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Poll-suggests-support-for-legal-sports-betting"><a href="#Poll-suggests-support-for-legal-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="Poll suggests support for legal sports betting"></a>Poll suggests support for legal sports betting</h1><p>After the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law prohibiting sports betting outside Nevada, a new poll suggests that most Americans support legalizing the practice.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, found that 61 percent of respondents supported legalizing sports betting, while only 33 percent were opposed.</p>
<p>The poll also found that there was majority support for legalization among all demographic groups, with younger Americans being the most likely to support it.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalization argue that it would generate new tax revenue, create jobs, and reduce illegal gambling. Opponents argue that it could lead to addiction and corruption.</p>
<p>Since the Supreme Court’s decision, several states have already moved to legalize sports betting, and more are expected to do so in the coming months and years.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-betting-legalization-inches-closer-to-reality"><a href="#Sports-betting-legalization-inches-closer-to-reality" class="headerlink" title="Sports betting legalization inches closer to reality"></a>Sports betting legalization inches closer to reality</h1><p>On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could legalize sports betting across the country. The case centers around New Jersey’s attempt to overturn a federal law that bans sports betting in most states.</p>
<p>If the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey, it would open the door for other states to legalize sports betting. This would be a major victory for the gaming industry, which has been pushing for sports betting legalization for many years.</p>
<p>The potential impact of legalized sports betting is huge. It could generate billions of dollars in revenue for state governments and the gaming industry. It could also create thousands of new jobs.</p>
<p>There is strong bipartisan support for sports betting legalization. Many lawmakers see it as a way to generate much-needed revenue for their states. They also believe that it will help create new jobs and stimulate economic growth.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates and organized crime involvement in sports betting. However, there is little evidence that these concerns are warranted.</p>
<p>The outcome of the Supreme Court case remains to be seen, but it appears that legalized sports betting is only a matter of time.</p>

Bingo halls across the country are capitalizing on this trend by offering sports betting as an option for their players.</p>
<p>Sports betting can be a lot of fun, and it can also be lucrative if you know what you’re doing. There are a lot of different ways to bet on sports, and each way has its own set of risks and rewards. If you’re new to sports betting, it’s important to learn about all the different types of bets so that you can make smart decisions when placing your bets.</p>
<p>There are three basic types of sports bets: moneyline bets, point spread bets, and totals bets. Moneyline bets are simple – you just bet on which team will win the game. Point spread bets are a bit more complex, as they involve predicting how many points one team will beat the other team by. Totals bets are wagers on how many points will be scored in the entire game.</p>
<p>In addition to these three basic types of bets, there are also a number of other specialty bets that you can make. For example, you can bet on which team will score first, or which player will score the most points. You can also bet on whether or not there will be overtime, or whether either team will score in the last few minutes of the game.</p>
<p>The great thing about sports betting is that there is something for everyone.

<h1 id="Sports-Betting-Becomes-Available-at-All-Bingo-Halls-in-Nevada"><a href="#Sports-Betting-Becomes-Available-at-All-Bingo-Halls-in-Nevada" class="headerlink" title="Sports Betting Becomes Available at All Bingo Halls in Nevada"></a>Sports Betting Becomes Available at All Bingo Halls in Nevada</h1><p>Nevada’s Gaming Control Board has voted unanimously to approve a measure that would allow sports betting at all of the state’s bingo halls. The measure will now head to the state legislature for final approval.</p>
<p>The vote marks a significant change in policy for Nevada, which has long been seen as a gambling stronghold. All forms of sports betting have been banned in the state since 1951, but the rise of online gambling and the legalization of sports betting in other states has led to calls for reform in Nevada.</p>
<p>Supporters of the measure say that it will help preserve the state’s gambling industry, which is facing increasing competition from other states. They also argue that allowing sports betting at bingo halls will help boost tourism in Nevada.</p>
<p>Opponents of the measure argue that it will lead to increased crime and gambling addiction. They also say that it will hurt Nevada’s casino industry, which is already struggling due to competition from other states.</p>
<p>The measure is expected to face strong opposition in the state legislature, but supporters are optimistic that it will be approved. If passed, it would go into effect on January 1, 2019.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Offers-Sports-Betting-at-Selected-Bingo-Halls"><a href="#Delaware-Offers-Sports-Betting-at-Selected-Bingo-Halls" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Offers Sports Betting at Selected Bingo Halls"></a>Delaware Offers Sports Betting at Selected Bingo Halls</h1><p>The state of Delaware has announced that it will offer sports betting at certain bingo halls. The move is an effort to take advantage of the recent US Supreme Court decision that overturned a ban on sports betting.</p>
<p>Bingo players in Delaware will be able to place bets on professional and college sporting events at six locations. The venues include three hall in Kent County, one in Sussex County, and two in New Castle County.</p>
<p>The state is still working out the details on how the sports betting will be implemented. Officials say that they are still waiting for regulations from the Delaware Gaming Commission. It’s unclear whether players will be able to place bets online or over the phone.</p>
<p>Delaware was one of the first states to legalize gambling after the US Supreme Court rulings. In June, the court struck down a law that prevented states from legalizing sports betting. Since then, several states have moved to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>Delaware officials estimate that there is $220 million worth of illegal sports betting in the state each year. They hope that legalizing sports betting will bring some of that money into the legal market.</p>
<p>Officials say that they are expecting a large influx of bettors from neighboring states such as Pennsylvania and New Jersey. In those states, lawmakers are still working out how to regulate and tax sports betting.</p>

        <h1 id="Blackjack-at-Curie-for-Fun-and-Profit"><a href="#Blackjack-at-Curie-for-Fun-and-Profit" class="headerlink" title="Blackjack at Curie for Fun and Profit!"></a>Blackjack at Curie for Fun and Profit!</h1><p>Curie is one of the top destinations for blackjack in the world and offers both great fun and opportunities to make some money. If you’re new to the game, we have some tips to help you get started.</p>
<h1 id="The-Basics"><a href="#The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="The Basics"></a>The Basics</h1><p> blackjack is a card game that pits player against dealer. The objective is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. Face cards are worth 10 points each, numerals are worth their face value, and aces can be either 1 or 11 points, depending on what makes a better hand.</p>
<p>After the cards are dealt, players must decide whether to “hit” (draw another card) or “stand” (hold the cards they currently have). If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically. The player whose hand has the highest total wins the pot.</p>
<h1 id="Curie’s-Blackjack-Tables"><a href="#Curie’s-Blackjack-Tables" class="headerlink" title="Curie’s Blackjack Tables"></a>Curie’s Blackjack Tables</h1><p>There are a variety of blackjack tables available at Curie, each with its own betting limits. In general, the higher the limit, the more lucrative the game. However, remember that it’s also riskier to play at high limits; if you lose your entire stack, you’re out of luck.</p>
<p>At Curie, we recommend starting with lower stakes tables until you feel comfortable with the game. This will allow you to learn how to play without risking too much money. You can always move up later if you wish.</p>
<h1 id="Basic-Strategy"><a href="#Basic-Strategy" class="headerlink" title="Basic Strategy"></a>Basic Strategy</h1><p>Now that you know how to play blackjack, it’s time to learn some strategy! There are many different ways to play each hand, but some basic principles will help improve your chances of winning.<br>In general, you should try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. If the dealer has less than 17 points showing, you should “stand” (not take any more cards). This gives the dealer a higher chance of busting and losing the hand. If the dealer has 17 points or more, you should usually “hit” (take another card). This increases your chances of winning by giving yourself better odds against a potentially high-value dealer hand.<br>A final note: if you have multiple cards totaling 21 (a so-called “blackjack”), you automatically win regardless of what the dealer has!</p>

<p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer’s hand without going over 21 points. You can do this by either getting paid on your first two cards, or by taking a hit (drawing another card). If your hand total is higher than the dealer’s hand total, you win!</p>

        <h1 id="Korea-Slot-Machine-reveals-its-original-name"><a href="#Korea-Slot-Machine-reveals-its-original-name" class="headerlink" title="Korea Slot Machine reveals its original name!"></a>Korea Slot Machine reveals its original name!</h1><p>The Korea Slot Machine Association has recently revealed the Korean name of slot machines, which is “Beomjulgi” (범주기). The reveal took place during the annual meeting of the Korea Slot Machine Association on the 24th of January. This year’s meeting theme was “The Future of Beomjulgi and Safe Betting.”</p>
<p>The reveal was made in order to increase understanding and usage of the term ‘Beomjulgi’ among Koreans. As such, the National Gambling Control Commission and other government organizations have been working with the Korea Slot Machine Association to try and popularize the term.</p>
<p>During the meeting, it was also announced that there will be a new category for Beomjulgi called ‘Megabonus’. This category offers larger payouts, and will include machines with bet limits of 50,000 won or more. This is an attempt by the Korea Slot Machine Association to address criticisms that slot machines are designed to take advantage of gamblers.</p>
<p>The Korea Slot Machine Association also discussed how it plans to work with casinos in order to prevent underage gambling and problem gambling. The meeting concluded with a pledge by casino operators to tighten their rules on who can enter their establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Bingo-Korea-Slot-Machine-to-unveil-name-change-soon"><a href="#Bingo-Korea-Slot-Machine-to-unveil-name-change-soon" class="headerlink" title="Bingo Korea Slot Machine to unveil name change soon!"></a>Bingo Korea Slot Machine to unveil name change soon!</h1><p>The popular online Bingo game in Korea is set to unveil a name change, as the game undergoes its second major update this year.</p>
<p>According to sources from within the company, the new name for the game will be revealed in early October. The rebranding is said to be in line with a shift in strategy for the game, which will now focus on promotional events and social interaction between players.</p>
<p>Bingo Korea has been hugely successful since its launch in 2014, gaining millions of users across the country. The name change is hoped to reinvigorate interest in the game and bring in even more players.</p>
<p>Details on what the new name will be have not yet been released, but it is speculated that it could be inspired by Korean culture or history. Stay tuned for updates!</p>
<h1 id="Korea-Slot-Machine-to-change-its-name-again"><a href="#Korea-Slot-Machine-to-change-its-name-again" class="headerlink" title="Korea Slot Machine to change its name again?"></a>Korea Slot Machine to change its name again?</h1><p>After the ban on slot machines in 2009, the South Korean government has been mulling over a new bill to legalize them again. The bill has been in the works for two years and it looks like it might finally be passed soon. Slot machines will be renamed “game machines” and will only be allowed in places where people can drink alcohol.</p>
<p>The main reason for legalizing slot machines is to help out the country’s tourism industry. Slot machines account for 60% of casino income and make up 35% of tourism income. With the global economy struggling, South Korea is looking for new ways to bring in tourists and boost its economy. In addition, there are concerns that the underground gambling market is growing too large and needs to be regulated.</p>
<p>The government is expecting around ₩2 trillion (US$1.8 billion) in additional tax revenue from legalizing slot machines. They also expect around 200,000 jobs to be created in the casino and amusement park industries. Proponents of the bill say that it will help reduce crime rates and improve economic conditions in depressed areas.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that legalizing slot machines will cause addiction problems and social ills. They also argue that it will lead to an increase in gambling debts, crime, and poverty. So far there hasn’t been much evidence to support these claims, but time will tell if they are accurate or not.</p>
<p>It looks like the legalization of slot machines is a done deal, but there are still some details that need to be ironed out. There is no set date for when they will be legalized, but it should happen sometime this year. South Korea has always been a leader in technology and this latest move is sure to make waves in the global gaming industry.</p>

        <h1 id="Libya-Rules-How-to-Play-Casino-the-Greeting-Card-Game"><a href="#Libya-Rules-How-to-Play-Casino-the-Greeting-Card-Game" class="headerlink" title="Libya Rules: How to Play Casino the Greeting Card Game"></a>Libya Rules: How to Play Casino the Greeting Card Game</h1><p>Libya Rules is a casino game that can be played with as few as two players or as many as eight. It’s best for four to six players, and the object of the game is to score points by taking tricks. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.</p>
<p>To begin, all of the players are dealt four cards face down, and the dealer is left with four cards face up. The player on the dealer’s left starts the game by flipping over the top card of their deck – this is their must play card. They then play one of their other three cards either forcing another player to play one of their cards too, or playing it themselves (face down). If they cannot play any of their cards, they draw one from the deck and keep playing until they can. The other players in turn then follow suit, flipping over their top card and playing it if possible. When two consecutive players cannot play any cards, then the player who last flipped over a card picks up both of those cards and sets them aside – these are now out of the game. This process continues until all of the players have no more cards left in their hand. At this point, each player flips over the last card in their deck to see what number it is. The player with the highest number is awarded one point, and whoever has taken the most tricks (or ties for first place) wins!</p>
<p>Some things to remember:<br> -If you are forced to play a card and don’t have any more matching suits in your hand, you can play any other card (even if it doesn’t match).<br>-When you pick up a pair of cards, set them aside face down – these are now out of the game.</p>
<h1 id="Learn-the-Rules-of-Casino-A-Greeting-Card-Game-from-Libya"><a href="#Learn-the-Rules-of-Casino-A-Greeting-Card-Game-from-Libya" class="headerlink" title="Learn the Rules of Casino: A Greeting Card Game from Libya"></a>Learn the Rules of Casino: A Greeting Card Game from Libya</h1><p>The objective of Casino is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.</p>
<p>To play, each player is dealt 13 cards, one at a time. The first card is placed face up in the middle of the table, then each player discards one card to their left. This forms the player’s hand for the remainder of the game. The face-up card in the middle of the table is called the “widow.”</p>
<p>The player to the dealer’s left starts the bidding by naming any number (1-13). The next player then either bids higher or passes. This continues until all players have either passed or bid higher than the last player. The high bidder then takes the widow and adds it to their hand. They then exchange any number of cards with their opponents (including zero), equal to the number they bid. For example, if they bid 5, they can exchange up to 5 cards with their opponents (although they may not exchange more than 3 cards if they are playing with 3 other people).</p>
<p>The highest trump played wins the trick and captures any wildcards played. If there are no trumps, then the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and captures any wildcards played. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.</p>
<p>The aim of Casino is to take as many tricks as possible. Points are scored for taking tricks, capturing certain cards, and bonus points for going “bust”. A player scores 1 point for every card taken in a trick, 2 points for taking the jack of diamonds (“right bower”), 4 points for taking both queens of clubs (“left bower”), and 10 points for going “bust”. At any time, a player can call “point” and set this score as their current score instead of adding further points to it; subsequent plays will continue from this score. When one side reaches 100 or more points, that side wins automatically (unless playing with negative scores - see Scoring below).</p>

The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are high and 2s are low.</p>
<p>The player who is eldest starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player’s turn, they draw one or more cards from the stock, and then discard one card. The player can either draw all their cards at once (if they have fewer than 6) or take two cards at a time.</p>
<p>A player can only discard if they have six or more cards. When discarding, a player must place a card face up on the table. This card is then used as the beginning of the next turn’s discard pile.</p>
<p>The aim of Casino is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards. The winner is the player with the highest hand, or if there is a tie then the player with the highest card in their hand wins.</p>
<p>Here are some of the hands you can achieve in Casino:</p>
<p>One pair: Two cards of the same rank e.g. two kings<br>Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank e.g three queens<br>Straight: Five consecutive ranks e.g 4, 5, 6, 7, 8<br>Flush: Any five cards of the same suit e.g 3 hearts, 7 spades, 9 clubs etc<br>Full house: Three of one rank and two of another rank e.g three fives and two tens<br>Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank e.g four jacks<br>straight flush: Five consecutive ranks of the same suit e.g 5 ,6,7,8,9 clubs</p>

The first player looks at their cards and decides if they want to keep them or not. If they keep them, they must place a bet equal to the number of cards they are keeping. If they don’t keep them, they must fold and lose the bet.</p>
<p>The second player then looks at their hand and decides what to do. They can either keep their hand or fold. If they keep their hand, they must also place a bet equal to the number of cards they are keeping. If they fold, they lose the bet.</p>
<p>This process repeats until all players have either folded or kept their hand. The last player standing then wins the pot.</p>

<h1 id="Playing-Casino-the-Greeting-Card-Game-from-Libya"><a href="#Playing-Casino-the-Greeting-Card-Game-from-Libya" class="headerlink" title="Playing Casino, the Greeting Card Game from Libya"></a>Playing Casino, the Greeting Card Game from Libya</h1><p>A recent craze in Libya is a card game called casino. It is said to have been brought over from Tunisia and is now played by almost everyone. The object of the game is to collect as many cards as possible to make up sets and runs.</p>
<p>The basic rules are as follows: there are three kinds of cards - numbered cards (1-10), face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and group cards (Ace, Two, Three). The aim is to collect as many different types of card as possible. Face cards count for 10 points each and numbered cards one point each. Aces are high or low - so an Ace and a Two make up a set, as do a Nine and a Ten.</p>
<p>To begin the game, each player is dealt six cards face down. The player with the highest card in their hand begins the play and the turn passes clockwise. On a player’s turn they must play one card face up on the table. This becomes the Active Card. If they can add their card to an existing sequence on the table then they can take the sequence - moving it in front of them so that they now have seven cards. Or they can choose to keep their card if they cannot make any addition to an existing sequence.</p>
<p>If the Active Card matches one of the player’s own cards then they can take it from the table and replace it with another from their hand - but if there are no matching cards then they must pick up all of the cards on the table apart from the Active Card which remains in place. When all players have either played or picked up all six of their original cards, each player is then dealt three new ones so that they again have six cards. This process repeats until one player has no more cards left in their hand at which point they are declared the winner.</p>
<p>The following hands illustrate how casino can be played:</p>
<pre><code> 1
</code></pre>
<p>7    2<br>8   &#x2F;\ 3<br>9 4</p>
<p> In this hand, player one starts with 1 7 , since this is the highest card present in their hand. They play this out onto the table as their Active Card and draw another card from their deck making them end up with a total of 6 . Player two now plays their 2 8 onto the table which means that player one can now take possession of both these particular numbers ( 1 7 and 2 8 ) within their set provided that player two has no other playing options left on his turn. If player two had instead played 3 9 , thereby extending the set already on table, then player one could not have taken possession because another card would need to be played in order for them to do so; 3 9 would still be hanging around on table as part of that sequence . Finally, when player three plays 4 , this just becomes added value to what is already present on table; it does not form any additional sequences by itself so none are captured by this particular move made by player three . At this point, players four - six would all draw fresh replacement hands of 3 new randomly dealt cards sized down so that only 6 are held once again).</p>

<li><p>Practice - It is always a good idea to practice before playing for real money. This will help you get familiar with the game and the different types of bets that are available. You can practice for free on many websites or even download free poker software onto your computer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Choose your games wisely - Not all games offer the same odds of winning. It is important to choose games that fit your skill level and give you the best chance of winning. For beginners, it may be wise to start out with lower stakes games until you become more comfortable with the game play.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use betting strategies - There are a number of different betting strategies that can be used in order to increase your chances of winning. One popular strategy is called “The Martingale System” which involves doubling your bet after each loss in an effort to eventually win back your losses plus one unit profit. You can research different betting strategies online or ask experienced players for advice on what has worked best for them.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Stay calm - One of the keys to winning at poker is staying calm under pressure. When playing for real money, it is important not to get too emotionally attached to either your wins or losses. Try not to let bad beats upset you and stay focused on making smart decisions that will give you the best chance of winning in the long run</p>
