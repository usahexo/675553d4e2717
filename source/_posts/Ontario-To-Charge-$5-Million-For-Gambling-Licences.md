#  Ontario To Charge $5 Million For Gambling Licences

Ontario announced last week that the province will start charging businesses $5 million for gambling licences. The move is expected to bring in an additional $50 million in revenue for the province each year.

“This new fee will help us ensure that Ontario’s gambling sector is safe and responsible, while generating important new revenue to support provincial priorities,” said Jeff Leal, Minister of Government and Consumer Services.

The fees will be charged for all types of gambling licences, including those for casinos, slot machines, and bingo halls. Licences for online gambling will also be subject to the new fee.

The government says the money raised from the fees will be put towards programs that protect vulnerable people and combat problem gambling. It will also be used to fund enhanced enforcement activities in the gambling sector.

This isn’t the first time Ontario has charged businesses for gambling licences. In 2013, the province introduced a $5 million fee for business wishing to operate video lottery terminals (VLTs).

Opposition critics say the move is another cash grab by the Liberal government. They argue that the money could be better spent on other important programs such as health care and education.

#  Alberta Plans To Raise Gambling Licence Fees

The provincial government in Alberta is planning to increase gambling licence fees as part of its budget for the upcoming fiscal year. The government says that the increase is necessary to cover the rising costs associated with regulating and monitoring the gambling industry.

The new fee structure will see the cost of a gambling licence increase from $1,000 to $5,000 for casinos and from $250 to $1,500 for other types of gambling establishments. The government says that the increased fees will generate an additional $4 million in revenue annually.

Gambling is a major industry in Alberta, with over $2 billion being wagered each year. The government estimates that it spends approximately $15 million annually on regulatory and monitoring activities related to gambling.

Opposition parties have criticized the fee increase, saying that it will hurt businesses in the province and lead to job losses. They argue that the government should be looking for ways to reduce costs, not increase them.

The new fee structure is expected to take effect on April 1, 2019.

#  Manitoba Proposes Increases To Gambling Licence Fees 

Introducing a new budget proposal, the Manitoba government is looking to increase gambling licence fees in an effort to bolster revenue.

The proposed increases would see the fees for casinos, racetracks, and charity gaming rise from $2 million to $5 million annually. This would be the first increase to gambling licence fees in Manitoba since 1992.

In justifying the move, Finance Minister Greg Dewar pointed to the fact that gambling revenues in the province have more than doubled over the past decade. He also highlighted the fact that Manitoba has the lowest gambling fees in Canada.

Opposition parties were quick to criticize the proposal, with Progressive Conservative Party leader Brian Pallister calling it a "cash grab". noting that it would hurt small businesses and charities.

The Manitoba government estimates that the proposed increases would bring in an additional $10 million per year in revenue.

#  New Brunswick Considers Charging More For Gambling Licences 

Government officials in New Brunswick are considering increasing fees for gambling licences as a way to offset the costs of regulating and policing the industry.

The province currently charges $10,000 for a casino licence and $2,500 for a gaming licence. Officials are now proposing to increase those fees to $50,000 and $5,000, respectively.

According to New Brunswick Finance Minister Cathy Rogers, the increased fees would generate an additional $1 million per year for the government. That money would be used to hire more police officers and inspectors to oversee the gambling industry.

Rogers also said that the proposed fee increases are part of a larger effort by the provincial government to increase its revenues. New Brunswick is facing a budget deficit of more than $600 million this year.

Gambling is a big business in New Brunswick. The province has two casinos (one in Moncton and one in Saint John) as well as nearly 1,700 video lottery terminals (VLTs) at bars and restaurants throughout the province.

The New Brunswick government currently makes about $200 million per year from gambling revenues. That money goes towards funding important programs such as healthcare and education.

But with budget deficits mounting, the government is looking for ways to increase its revenue from gambling. The proposed fee increases would be just one way of doing that.

Some people don’t believe that the proposed fee increases are fair. They argue that it’s already expensive enough to operate a casino or gaming establishment in New Brunswick, and that raising licensing fees will only make things harder for business owners.

Others say that the increased fees are necessary in order to cover the costs of regulating and policing the gambling industry. They argue that it’s important to have a strong regulatory framework in place in order to protect consumers and prevent crime.

#  Quebec Mulls Over Raising Fees For Gambling Licences

Quebec is planning to increase gambling licence fees to help bolster its budget. The government has been looking for new sources of revenue as its deficit continues to grow.

Currently, the cost of a gambling licence in Quebec is $100. Under the proposed changes, this would go up to $1,000 for casinos and $500 for other types of gambling establishments.

The government says that this will help it bring in an additional $13 million per year. It plans to use the money to fund programs aimed at reducing addiction and social problems caused by gambling.

The proposal has faced some criticism, with opponents arguing that it will discourage businesses from opening up in Quebec. However, the government maintains that the increased fees are justified, given the potential social costs of gambling.

Quebec is not the only province considering increasing gambling fees. Earlier this year, Ontario announced plans to double its licence fees from $5,000 to $10,000.
