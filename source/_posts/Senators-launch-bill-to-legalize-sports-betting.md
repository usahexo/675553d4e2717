#  Senators launch bill to legalize sports betting

WASHINGTON - October 26, 2017 

A bipartisan group of Senators have announced a new bill that would legalize sports betting in the United States. The proposed legislation comes in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to strike down a federal law that prohibited most states from authorizing sports gambling.

The bill, which was introduced by Senators Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Mike Lee (R-UT), would allow states to decide whether to legalize and regulate sports betting within their borders. The proposed legislation would also establish a regulatory framework for sports betting, including minimum age restrictions, consumer protections, and safeguards against fraud and game-fixing.

"I'm thrilled that Senator Schumer and Senator Lee are introducing this bill," said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the American Gaming Association. "It is critical that we provide a legislative framework that allows for responsible gaming in states that choose to legalize it. This bill does just that."

Opponents of legalizing sports betting argue that it could lead to increased rates of problem gambling, but supporters say that such concerns can be mitigated through strong consumer protections. They also note that legalization could generate significant revenue for state governments through taxes on bets made at casinos and other gambling establishments.

#  Rep. proposes RAWA repeal in bid to legalize sports betting

A U.S. lawmaker has put forward a measure to repeal the failed federal ban on sports betting, arguing that it would generate some $27 billion in annual tax revenue.

The proposal to overturn the RAWA (Restoration of America's Wire Act) was put forth by Republican Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah on Wednesday. The bill intends to legalize and regulate sports betting at the state level.

"This is a conservative estimate," Bishop said in a statement, noting that the regulated market would also create jobs while protecting consumers and children from illegal gambling activities. "If we don't pass this legislation, these dollars will go to other countries, and our states will continue to lose out on vital revenue."

Bishop joins several lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who have voiced their support for legalizing and regulating sports betting in light of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last month to strike down a federal law that effectively outlawed it. The high court ruled that the law – known as PASPA (Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act) – violated the 10th Amendment by compelling states to prohibit wagering on sporting events.

Since the ruling, several states have signaled their intention to move forward with legalizing sports betting within their borders. Delaware became the first state to allow single-game bets last week, followed by New Jersey – which is expected to begin taking bets within weeks – and West Virginia, which plans to offer sports betting by September. Mississippi also approved a measure this week that would allow casinos in the state to offer legal sports betting pending approval from regulators.

Critics of RAWA say that its passage would not only overturn decades of legal precedent but also conflict with the wishes of most Americans, who support legalizing sports betting. A poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in May found that 67 percent of Americans favor allowing legalized sports betting nationwide, including Republicans (57 percent), Democrats (77 percent) and independents (68 percent).

#  Sports gambling could be legalized by the end of the year

States are close to reaching an agreement that would legalize sports gambling across the nation. The proposed bill, which was introduced by Republican Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, would overturn a 1992 law that effectively banned sports gambling.

The bill would allow states to individually decide whether or not to legalize sports gambling and would give them authority to regulate and tax the activity. In addition, it would create a federal regulatory framework for sports betting operators.

“The current state-by-state approach to sports betting is patently unfair,” Hatch said in a statement. “It’s time to bring this longstanding issue out of the shadows and into the light of day.”

Sports gambling is currently legal in only four states: Nevada, Delaware, Oregon, and Montana. The proposed bill would enable states with existing gaming laws – such as New Jersey – to offer full-scale sports betting operations.

The NFL has been a vocal opponent of legalized sports gambling, but the league may be changing its tune. In a recent interview, NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league is open to legalized sports gambling if it includes “proper protections” for the game.

Goodell said that he doesn’t want legalized gambling to change the fundamental nature of the NFL game or put players at risk of manipulation by gamblers. He also expressed concerns about underage gambling and addiction issues.

If passed, the proposed bill would take effect in January 2019.

#  Poll suggests support for legal sports betting

After the US Supreme Court overturned a federal law prohibiting sports betting outside Nevada, a new poll suggests that most Americans support legalizing the practice.

The poll, conducted by the University of Massachusetts Lowell, found that 61 percent of respondents supported legalizing sports betting, while only 33 percent were opposed.

The poll also found that there was majority support for legalization among all demographic groups, with younger Americans being the most likely to support it.

Supporters of legalization argue that it would generate new tax revenue, create jobs, and reduce illegal gambling. Opponents argue that it could lead to addiction and corruption.

Since the Supreme Court’s decision, several states have already moved to legalize sports betting, and more are expected to do so in the coming months and years.

#  Sports betting legalization inches closer to reality

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear a case that could legalize sports betting across the country. The case centers around New Jersey’s attempt to overturn a federal law that bans sports betting in most states.

If the Supreme Court rules in favor of New Jersey, it would open the door for other states to legalize sports betting. This would be a major victory for the gaming industry, which has been pushing for sports betting legalization for many years.

The potential impact of legalized sports betting is huge. It could generate billions of dollars in revenue for state governments and the gaming industry. It could also create thousands of new jobs.

There is strong bipartisan support for sports betting legalization. Many lawmakers see it as a way to generate much-needed revenue for their states. They also believe that it will help create new jobs and stimulate economic growth.

Opponents of legalization argue that it will lead to increased gambling addiction rates and organized crime involvement in sports betting. However, there is little evidence that these concerns are warranted.

The outcome of the Supreme Court case remains to be seen, but it appears that legalized sports betting is only a matter of time.
