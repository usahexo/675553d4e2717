#  What are the pros and cons of each mode of transportation between Ledge Castle Casino and FC Internazionale Milano?

Casual observers of the Milan-based football club Internazionale Milano (commonly referred to as Inter) might be forgiven for thinking that their serene, tree-lined home ground, the San Siro stadium, is located in the heart of the city. In fact, it’s located on the outskirts of town, some distance from the city centre. And getting there is not always easy, thanks to heavy traffic and a lack of public transportation options.

There are three main ways of getting from Ledge Castle Casino (the closest casino to San Siro) to Inter’s stadium: car, bus, or taxi. Let’s take a look at the pros and cons of each option.

CAR

The upside of driving is that you have complete control over your journey and can go at your own pace. You can also make multiple stops along the way if you need to run errands or pick up friends or family members. The downside is that traffic in Milan can be notoriously bad, especially on match days, so it can often take much longer to get to the stadium than you expected. And if you’re not familiar with the city’s road layout, getting lost is a very real possibility.

BUS

The bus is probably the cheapest option when it comes to getting from Ledge Castle Casino to Inter’s stadium, but it can also be quite time-consuming. This is because there are no direct buses that go from Ledge Castle Casino to San Siro – you have to change buses at least once along the way. Furthermore, buses in Milan are often crowded and full of people who are making their way to the match – not ideal if you’re looking for a stress-free journey!

TAXI

Taxis are by far the most expensive option when it comes to travelling between Ledge Castle Casino and Inter’s stadium, but they are also by far the most convenient. Taxis are available 24/7 and can take you directly from your door to San Siro without having to change buses or navigate heavy traffic. The downside of taking a taxi is that they can be quite expensive – especially on match days when demand is high.
