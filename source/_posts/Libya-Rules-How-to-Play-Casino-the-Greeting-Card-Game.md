#  Libya Rules: How to Play Casino the Greeting Card Game


Libya Rules is a casino game that can be played with as few as two players or as many as eight. It’s best for four to six players, and the object of the game is to score points by taking tricks. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.

To begin, all of the players are dealt four cards face down, and the dealer is left with four cards face up. The player on the dealer’s left starts the game by flipping over the top card of their deck – this is their must play card. They then play one of their other three cards either forcing another player to play one of their cards too, or playing it themselves (face down). If they cannot play any of their cards, they draw one from the deck and keep playing until they can. The other players in turn then follow suit, flipping over their top card and playing it if possible. When two consecutive players cannot play any cards, then the player who last flipped over a card picks up both of those cards and sets them aside – these are now out of the game. This process continues until all of the players have no more cards left in their hand. At this point, each player flips over the last card in their deck to see what number it is. The player with the highest number is awarded one point, and whoever has taken the most tricks (or ties for first place) wins!

Some things to remember:
 -If you are forced to play a card and don’t have any more matching suits in your hand, you can play any other card (even if it doesn’t match).
-When you pick up a pair of cards, set them aside face down – these are now out of the game.

The objective of Casino is to score points by taking as many tricks as possible. The player who takes the most tricks wins the game.

To play, each player is dealt 13 cards, one at a time. The first card is placed face up in the middle of the table, then each player discards one card to their left. This forms the player's hand for the remainder of the game. The face-up card in the middle of the table is called the "widow."

The player to the dealer's left starts the bidding by naming any number (1-13). The next player then either bids higher or passes. This continues until all players have either passed or bid higher than the last player. The high bidder then takes the widow and adds it to their hand. They then exchange any number of cards with their opponents (including zero), equal to the number they bid. For example, if they bid 5, they can exchange up to 5 cards with their opponents (although they may not exchange more than 3 cards if they are playing with 3 other people).

The highest trump played wins the trick and captures any wildcards played. If there are no trumps, then the highest card of the suit led wins the trick and captures any wildcards played. The winner of each trick leads to the next trick.

The aim of Casino is to take as many tricks as possible. Points are scored for taking tricks, capturing certain cards, and bonus points for going "bust". A player scores 1 point for every card taken in a trick, 2 points for taking the jack of diamonds ("right bower"), 4 points for taking both queens of clubs ("left bower"), and 10 points for going "bust". At any time, a player can call "point" and set this score as their current score instead of adding further points to it; subsequent plays will continue from this score. When one side reaches 100 or more points, that side wins automatically (unless playing with negative scores - see Scoring below).

In Casino, players draw cards to try and achieve the best hand possible. The game is played with a regular deck of 52 cards. Aces are high and 2s are low.

The player who is eldest starts the game and play passes clockwise. On a player’s turn, they draw one or more cards from the stock, and then discard one card. The player can either draw all their cards at once (if they have fewer than 6) or take two cards at a time.

A player can only discard if they have six or more cards. When discarding, a player must place a card face up on the table. This card is then used as the beginning of the next turn’s discard pile.

The aim of Casino is to be the first player to get rid of all their cards. The winner is the player with the highest hand, or if there is a tie then the player with the highest card in their hand wins.

Here are some of the hands you can achieve in Casino:

One pair: Two cards of the same rank e.g. two kings
Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank e.g three queens
Straight: Five consecutive ranks e.g 4, 5, 6, 7, 8

Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank e.g four jacks  
straight flush: Five consecutive ranks of the same suit e.g 5 ,6,7,8,9 clubs

To play Casino, you will need a deck of cards. Dealer deals five cards to each player, face down. The rest of the cards are placed in the middle of the players, face down. The first player looks at their cards and decides if they want to keep them or not. If they keep them, they must place a bet equal to the number of cards they are keeping. If they don’t keep them, they must fold and lose the bet.

The second player then looks at their hand and decides what to do. They can either keep their hand or fold. If they keep their hand, they must also place a bet equal to the number of cards they are keeping. If they fold, they lose the bet.

This process repeats until all players have either folded or kept their hand. The last player standing then wins the pot.

#  Playing Casino, the Greeting Card Game from Libya

A recent craze in Libya is a card game called casino. It is said to have been brought over from Tunisia and is now played by almost everyone. The object of the game is to collect as many cards as possible to make up sets and runs.

The basic rules are as follows: there are three kinds of cards - numbered cards (1-10), face cards (Jack, Queen, King) and group cards (Ace, Two, Three). The aim is to collect as many different types of card as possible. Face cards count for 10 points each and numbered cards one point each. Aces are high or low - so an Ace and a Two make up a set, as do a Nine and a Ten.

To begin the game, each player is dealt six cards face down. The player with the highest card in their hand begins the play and the turn passes clockwise. On a player's turn they must play one card face up on the table. This becomes the Active Card. If they can add their card to an existing sequence on the table then they can take the sequence - moving it in front of them so that they now have seven cards. Or they can choose to keep their card if they cannot make any addition to an existing sequence.

If the Active Card matches one of the player's own cards then they can take it from the table and replace it with another from their hand - but if there are no matching cards then they must pick up all of the cards on the table apart from the Active Card which remains in place. When all players have either played or picked up all six of their original cards, each player is then dealt three new ones so that they again have six cards. This process repeats until one player has no more cards left in their hand at which point they are declared the winner.

The following hands illustrate how casino can be played:

     1
7    2
8   /\ 3
9 4



 In this hand, player one starts with 1 7 , since this is the highest card present in their hand. They play this out onto the table as their Active Card and draw another card from their deck making them end up with a total of 6 . Player two now plays their 2 8 onto the table which means that player one can now take possession of both these particular numbers ( 1 7 and 2 8 ) within their set provided that player two has no other playing options left on his turn. If player two had instead played 3 9 , thereby extending the set already on table, then player one could not have taken possession because another card would need to be played in order for them to do so; 3 9 would still be hanging around on table as part of that sequence . Finally, when player three plays 4 , this just becomes added value to what is already present on table; it does not form any additional sequences by itself so none are captured by this particular move made by player three . At this point, players four - six would all draw fresh replacement hands of 3 new randomly dealt cards sized down so that only 6 are held once again).
