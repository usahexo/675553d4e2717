#  What are the top 10 tips for improving your technical caching?

1. Use a modern caching engine such as memcached, redis or couchbase.
2. Choose the right data store for your needs - there is no "one size fits all" solution.
3. Implement hit-based caching to improve performance.
4. Tune your cache configuration for your specific application and data set.
5. Make sure you are using the right eviction policy for your data set and cache size.
6. Cache objects that are expensive to regenerate or retrieve from the database.
7. Keep your cache size in proportion to your hardware resources - don't over-cache or under-cache.
8. Use conditional GETs whenever possible to minimize network traffic and increase cache efficiency.
9. Monitor your cache performance and tweak settings as needed.
10. Never forget the importance of warmup - preloading your cache with representative data sets will improve performance overall

#  How do you improve your technical caching?

Cache is the backbone of a stable and scalable web application. Improving your caching can do wonders for your website and improve user experience. This article will cover some methods on how to improve your technical caching. 

One way to improve caching is through browser caching. Browser caching stores files, such as images and scripts, in a person’s local storage area so that they don’t have to download them again the next time they visit the page. Browser caching can be improved by setting the correct expires header values and adding Expires headers to static assets. You can also set a far future Expires header for resources that will not change often.

Another way to improve caching is through server-side caching. Server-side caching stores files, such as images and scripts, on the web server so that they are served faster to users than if they had to be downloaded each time from the database. You can improve server-side caching by setting up a reverse proxy cache or using a full-page cache plugin. You can also increase the PHP memory limit to allow more files to be cached.

Finally, you can use an object cache to store objects or small bits of data in memory, which eliminates the need to retrieve these objects from the database on each page load. This can be especially helpful for sites with high traffic volumes. You can use an object cache such as Memcached or Redis to improve performance.

By following these tips, you can improve your technical caching and see a noticeable improvement in website performance.

#  What are some techniques for improving your technical caching ability?

Technical caching is an important part of the web development process. In order to improve your technical caching ability, you need to first understand what it is and how it works.

Technical caching is a method of storing frequently accessed files in a temporary location on your computer so that they can be accessed quickly and easily. This speeds up the loading process of your website, which can result in improved performance for your visitors.

There are several techniques that you can use to improve your technical caching ability. One of the most important is to make sure that you are using a reliable caching plugin. A good caching plugin will store files in a temporary location on your computer, so that they can be accessed quickly and easily.

Another technique for improving your technical caching ability is to optimize your images. This involves reducing the size of your images so that they load more quickly on your website. You can use online tools such as TinyPNG or JPEG Mini to reduce the size of your images without compromising their quality.

You can also improve your technical caching ability by minifying your scripts and stylesheets. This involves removing unnecessary characters from these files so that they load more quickly on your website. You can use online tools such as MinifyMe or CSSTidy to do this automatically.

Finally, you can improve your technical caching ability by using a content delivery network (CDN). A CDN stores copies of your website’s files on servers around the world, so that they can be accessed quickly and easily by visitors no matter where they are located. This can result in a significant improvement in site performance for visitors from other parts of the world.

#  What can you do to make your technical caching better?

When it comes to optimizing your website, caching is one of the most important optimizations you can make. Caching allows your visitors to load pages faster by storing a copy of the rendered page or static asset on their computer or browser. This means that when they return to the same page, the cached copy is used instead of having to generate the entire page again.

There are a variety of different caching mechanisms available, but not all of them are suitable for every situation. In this article, we'll discuss some common caching mechanisms and when you should use them.

Static Assets

One easy way to improve performance is by caching static assets such as images, CSS files, and JavaScript files. These files don't change very often, so it makes sense to store them on the user's computer so they don't have to download them every time they visit your site.

Most web servers support static asset caching, so there's no need to write any special code. Simply include the correct header information in your HTML file and the web server will take care of the rest. For example, this line tells the server to cache the file for 1 year:

Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000

If you're using a content delivery network (CDN), you can also cache your static assets on their servers. This will further reduce the load on your own server and improve performance for your visitors.

HTML Pages

Caching HTML pages is a little more complicated than caching static assets, but it can be just as effective in improving performance. There are several different ways to cache HTML pages, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.



1) Server-Side Caching: One popular way to cache HTML pages is by using server-side caching. This involves storing copies of rendered pages on the web server. When a visitor requests a page, the server checks if it has a copy of the page in its cache. If it does, it serves up the cached version; if not, it renders the page and stores it in the cache for future requests. Server-side caching is easy to set up and usually doesn't require any additional code be added to your website. However, it can be difficult to manage cached pages if your website changes often or has a high traffic volume. In addition, not all web servers support server-side caching.




2) Browser Caching: Another popular way to cache HTML pages is by using browser caching. This involves storing copies of rendered pages on the visitor's computer. When a visitor requests a page, their browser checks if it has a copy of the page in its cache. If it does, it serves up the cached version; if not, it downloads the page from your website and stores it in its cache for future requests. Browser caching is easy to set up and usually doesn't require any additional code be added to your website. However, not all browsers support browser caching and cached pages may not be updated when they change on your website."

    3) HTTP Cache: The third way to cache HTML pages is by using an HTTP Cache such as Varnish or Squid . This involves storing copies of rendered pages on an external server that sits in front of your web server . When a visitor requests a page, their browser sends an HTTP request directly to the HTTP Cache server . The HTTP Cache server then forwards the request onto your web server , which renders and returns the requested page . The advantage of using an HTTP Cache is that it can handle large volumes of traffic , whereas most web servers cannot . The disadvantage is that setting up an HTTP Cache can be complicated and expensive . "

#  What are some tips for improving your technical caching skills?

Caching is a technique that can be used to improve the performance of your website or application. When caching is enabled, the system will store a copy of the requested data so that it can be accessed more quickly the next time it is requested. In this article, we will discuss some tips for improving your technical caching skills.

# 1. Understand how caching works

The first step towards improving your caching skills is to understand how caching works. When you cache data, you are storing a copy of that data so that it can be accessed more quickly the next time it is requested. This can improve the performance of your website or application by reducing the amount of time that is spent retrieving data from its original source.

Cacheable content is typically stored in a cache, which is a temporary storage area that can be accessed more quickly than the original source. When a request is made for content that has been cached, the system will check to see if a copy of that content is available in the cache. If it is, then the content will be served from the cache; if it is not, then the content will be retrieved from its original source and added to the cache.

There are two main types of caches: local caches and shared caches. A local cache stores data on the same device as the application or website that is using it. A shared cache, on the other hand, stores data on a separate device that can be accessed by multiple applications or websites.

# 2. Optimize your caching settings

Once you have understood how caching works, you need to start optimizing your caching settings. The optimal settings will vary depending on your specific application or website, but there are some general guidelines that you can follow:

- Enable caching: Enabling caching should be one of your first steps when optimizing your settings. Cacheable content can often be stored in a cache, which can improve performance by reducing retrieval time from its original source. - Configure your TTLs: TTL (time-to-live) specifies how long cached content should be stored before it expires and needs to be refreshed. You should set TTLs according to how frequently content changes on your site; for example, if you have static content that does not change often, you can use longer TTLs whereas if you have dynamic content that changes frequently, you will want shorter TTLs so that information is not cached for too long. - Use an appropriate storage space: Each type of cache has different storage requirements; for example, Local Storage only requires a few kilobytes per item while Memcached can require up to 1MB per item. Make sure you are using an appropriate storage space for your needs. - Use an appropriate eviction policy: Eviction policies determine what happens when there is not enough space in the cache to store all of the cached items; for example, whether older items are removed from the cache or newer items are replaced with older ones. Choose an eviction policy that best suits your needs and update it as needed based on changes in traffic or availability of resources. - Monitor and optimize: It is important to monitor your caching settings carefully and make any necessary adjustments based on changes in traffic or resource availability. Caching can have a significant impact on performance and incorrect settings can cause problems rather than solve them!


3 # 3 Follow best practices for caching HTML pages 

One common use case for caching is to speed up delivery of HTML pages to users’ browsers – this technique is often known as “page caching”. There are several best practices you should follow when configuring page caching: 

- Set an expiration date: The expiration date tells browsers when they should stop using the cached version of a page and request a new one from the server instead.. You should set an expiration date according to how frequently your pages change; for example, static pages without updated information could use an expiration date far in advance whereas pages with dynamic information would need a shorter expiration date so users always see up-to-date information.. - Specify an ETag header: The ETag header (entity tag) provides browsers with information about cached versions of pages so they know which ones need to be refreshed.. You should include this header whenever possible so browsers can use cached versions whenever possible.. - Minimize HTTP requests: Every time a browser makes a request for assets such as images or scripts associated with a page, it has to wait for a response before loading the page itself.. To avoid this delay, try combining files into as few requests as possible.. - Use Gzip compression: Compressing files before transmitting them decreases their size and allows browsers to download them more quickly.. Compression should generally be enabled unless there are specific files that should not be compressed .. 

By following these best practices when configuring page caching, you can dramatically improve page load times for users!
