#  What is the difference between Birds and Birds Game?

There is a big difference between the Birds app and the Birds game. The app is just an application that you can download on your phone or computer, while the game is a physical object that you can purchase at a store.

The app was created by Rovio Entertainment in 2009, and it is a casual puzzle video game where players use a slingshot to launch birds at pigs occupying various structures. The object of the game is to destroy all of the pigs on the playing field in order to progress to the next level.

The game was first released on November 12, 2009, in Australia. It was later released in other countries starting on December 11, 2009. An arcade adaptation of the game was released by Namco Bandai Games on January 21, 2010.

On March 25, 2014, Rovio announced that they had reached 1 billion downloads for the app, making it one of the most downloaded apps of all time. As of May 2015, it has been downloaded more than 2 billion times.

#  What are the bonus features in Birds Free Spins?

The bonus game in the Birds free spins slot is a straightforward Pick and Win type of game. You are given 9 tiles, which each conceal a different number of coins. Find 3 matching coins to win the corresponding prize. There is also a multiplier hidden among the tiles, which can multiply your prize by up to 10x if you find it.

The other bonus feature in this game is the free spins round. You can trigger it by landing 3 or more scatter symbols anywhere on the reels. Once triggered, you will be awarded 10 free spins, during which all prizes are doubled. This round can be retriggered an unlimited number of times for even more winning potential.

#  When did Birds premiere?

The TV show Birds premiered on September 12, 2016.

#  Who created the artwork for Birds?

The artwork for Birds was created by Syrian artist Nizar Rayan. Rayan is a self-taught artist who specializes in painting and sculpture. His work often reflects the conflict in Syria and its effects on the population.

Birds was commissioned by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) as part of their "Hope Mural" series. The mural is located in the Jabalia Refugee Camp in Gaza. It features a large flock of birds, each with a different message written on its wing.

The mural was created in response to the devastating 2014 conflict in Gaza, which left more than 2,000 Palestinians dead and thousands more injured. "Birds" is intended as a reminder of hope and resilience in the face of tragedy.
