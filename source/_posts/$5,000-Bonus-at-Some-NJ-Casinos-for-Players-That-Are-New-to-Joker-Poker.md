#  Play Joker Poker and Get a Free Spin on the 'Wheel of Fortune' Slot

In joker poker, there are 52 cards in the deck, including one joker. The ranking of the cards is the same as in regular poker, with Ace being high and 2 being low. The joker can be used as any other card in the deck.

To play, you bet on one of five boxes, which will be noted on the table. After all bets have been placed, each player is dealt five cards face down. The player to the dealer's left starts the betting, and players must either match the amount that has been bet or fold. Play passes clockwise around the table.

After the first betting round, the dealer flips over the first card in his or her hand. This is called the flop. Players now have a choice: they can either match the current bet or fold. Play again passes clockwise around the table.

The fourth card (the turn) is then flipped over, followed by a final betting round. The river is then flipped over (the fifth and final card). At this point, it becomes apparent who has won the pot - either by having the best hand or by having had opponents fold to them earlier in the game.
