#  Seahawks Sweep The Board In Week 1 Action

Seattle kicked off the NFL season in dominant fashion on Sunday, defeating the Denver Broncos 27-24 behind three touchdown passes from Russell Wilson.

It was a total team effort for the Seahawks, who got contributions from all over the roster. Doug Baldwin led Seattle in receiving with 59 yards and a touchdown, while Chris Carson pounded out 93 yards on the ground.

Defensively, Seattle’s Legion of Boom picked off Case Keenum twice and held Denver to just 277 total yards. Newly acquired defensive end Ezekiel Ansah made an immediate impact with two sacks.

The win puts the Seahawks at 1-0 and atop the NFC West standings. Up next is a Week 2 matchup against the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field.

#  Cowboys Fall To Giants As Bettors Clean Up

In what can be considered one of the most dramatic endings to a football game in recent memory, the Dallas Cowboys were upset by the New York Giants as Giants QB Eli Manning heaved a pass to wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. in the back of the end zone for a touchdown as time expired. The Giants won 27-26, and with the Cowboys suffering their second consecutive loss, sports bettors who had taken the Giants moneyline were cheering all the way to the bank.

The game was not without controversy, however, as Cowboys WR Dez Bryant appeared to make a catch in the end zone that would have given Dallas the win. But after referee reviews, it was ruled that Bryant did not maintain control of the ball through catching it and touching both feet down in bounds, thus ending the game with a Giant victory.

While some Cowboy fans are likely still bitter about this heartbreaking loss, they can take solace in knowing that their team is still one of the best in the NFL. And with star players such as Bryant, QB Tony Romo and RB Demarco Murray leading the way, there is no doubt that Dallas will be a force to be reckoned with as the season progresses.

#  Pats, Chiefs Bounce Back In Big Ways After Early Losses

Coming off of Week 1 losses, the New England Patriots and Kansas City Chiefs bounced back with big wins over the Houston Texans and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively.

The Patriots were led by their new-look offense, as quarterback Tom Brady threw for 277 yards and three touchdowns. The Patriots also got a big game from wide receiver Phillip Dorsett, who caught seven passes for 66 yards and two touchdowns.

The Chiefs, meanwhile, were led by their high-powered offense, as quarterback Patrick Mahomes threw for 326 yards and four touchdowns. Mahomes also added a rushing touchdown. Wide receiver Tyreek Hill had a huge game for the Chiefs, catching nine passes for 198 yards and two touchdowns.

Both the Patriots and Chiefs appear to be contenders once again this season.

#  Packers, 49ers Continue Dominant Play

In the NFC Divisional matchup, the Green Bay Packers hosted the San Francisco 49ers. It was a matchup of two teams who have been playing very well lately. The Packers started off strong, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. The 49ers were not able to respond, and the Packers took a 14-0 lead into halftime.

The 49ers came out strong in the second half, scoring a touchdown on their opening drive. However, the Packers responded with a touchdown of their own, putting the game out of reach. The 49ers were not able to score again, and the Packers won by a final score of 24-14.

This was an impressive win by the Packers, who continue to play very well this season. They will now advance to the NFC Championship Game, where they will face either the Seattle Seahawks or Atlanta Falcons.

#  Rams, Broncos Among Teams With Unexpected Wins

In Week 1, the Los Angeles Rams upset the Seattle Seahawks, dominating them 33-13. The Denver Broncos also had an unexpected win, topping the Carolina Panthers 21-20.

The Rams were led by their new head coach, Sean McVay. He is the youngest head coach in NFL history, and many experts doubted his ability to lead a team. However, McVay’s offense was able to effectively move the ball against the Seattle defense.

The Broncos were led by their quarterback Trevor Siemian. He had a shaky preseason but was able to play well against the Panthers. He completed 20 of 31 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns.

Both of these teams will look to continue their winning ways in Week 2. The Rams will take on the Washington Redskins, while the Broncos will face off against the Dallas Cowboys.
