#  Korea Slot Machine reveals its original name!

The Korea Slot Machine Association has recently revealed the Korean name of slot machines, which is "Beomjulgi" (범주기). The reveal took place during the annual meeting of the Korea Slot Machine Association on the 24th of January. This year's meeting theme was "The Future of Beomjulgi and Safe Betting."

The reveal was made in order to increase understanding and usage of the term 'Beomjulgi' among Koreans. As such, the National Gambling Control Commission and other government organizations have been working with the Korea Slot Machine Association to try and popularize the term.

During the meeting, it was also announced that there will be a new category for Beomjulgi called 'Megabonus'. This category offers larger payouts, and will include machines with bet limits of 50,000 won or more. This is an attempt by the Korea Slot Machine Association to address criticisms that slot machines are designed to take advantage of gamblers.

The Korea Slot Machine Association also discussed how it plans to work with casinos in order to prevent underage gambling and problem gambling. The meeting concluded with a pledge by casino operators to tighten their rules on who can enter their establishments.

#  Bingo Korea Slot Machine to unveil name change soon!

The popular online Bingo game in Korea is set to unveil a name change, as the game undergoes its second major update this year.

According to sources from within the company, the new name for the game will be revealed in early October. The rebranding is said to be in line with a shift in strategy for the game, which will now focus on promotional events and social interaction between players.

Bingo Korea has been hugely successful since its launch in 2014, gaining millions of users across the country. The name change is hoped to reinvigorate interest in the game and bring in even more players.

Details on what the new name will be have not yet been released, but it is speculated that it could be inspired by Korean culture or history. Stay tuned for updates!

#  Korea Slot Machine to change its name again?

After the ban on slot machines in 2009, the South Korean government has been mulling over a new bill to legalize them again. The bill has been in the works for two years and it looks like it might finally be passed soon. Slot machines will be renamed “game machines” and will only be allowed in places where people can drink alcohol.

The main reason for legalizing slot machines is to help out the country’s tourism industry. Slot machines account for 60% of casino income and make up 35% of tourism income. With the global economy struggling, South Korea is looking for new ways to bring in tourists and boost its economy. In addition, there are concerns that the underground gambling market is growing too large and needs to be regulated.

The government is expecting around ₩2 trillion (US$1.8 billion) in additional tax revenue from legalizing slot machines. They also expect around 200,000 jobs to be created in the casino and amusement park industries. Proponents of the bill say that it will help reduce crime rates and improve economic conditions in depressed areas.

Opponents of the bill argue that legalizing slot machines will cause addiction problems and social ills. They also argue that it will lead to an increase in gambling debts, crime, and poverty. So far there hasn’t been much evidence to support these claims, but time will tell if they are accurate or not.

It looks like the legalization of slot machines is a done deal, but there are still some details that need to be ironed out. There is no set date for when they will be legalized, but it should happen sometime this year. South Korea has always been a leader in technology and this latest move is sure to make waves in the global gaming industry.
